## Ethereum Classic Stratum Written In Go

### WARNING: This code is currently configured for the Ethereum Classic main network

### Features

**This stratum is being further developed to provide an easy to use stratum for Ethereum Classic miners. This software is functional however an optimised release of the pool frontend is expected soon. Testing and bug submissions are welcome!**

* Support for HTTP and Stratum mining
* Failover geth instances: geth high availability built in
* JSON-API for stats

### Building on Linux

Dependencies:

  * go >= 1.16.5
  * core-geth
  * redis-server >= 2.8.0

**We highly recommend to use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.**

First install  [core-geth](https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth/releases).

Clone & compile:

    git config --global http.https://gopkg.in.followRedirects true
    git clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai-stratum.git
    cd go-etcstratum
    make all

Install redis-server.

### Running Stratum

    ./build/bin/go-etcstratum config.json

You can use Ubuntu upstart - check for sample config in <code>upstart.conf</code>.


#### Serving API using nginx

Create an upstream for API:

    upstream api {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080;
    }

and add this setting after <code>location /</code>:

    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://api;
    }


### Configuration

Configuration is actually simple, just read it twice and think twice before changing defaults.

**Don't copy config directly from this manual. Use the example config from the package,
otherwise you will get errors on start because of JSON comments.**

```

If you are distributing your stratum deployment to several servers or processes,
create several configs and disable unneeded modules on each server. (Advanced users)

I recommend this deployment strategy:

* Mining instance - 1x (it depends, you can run one node for EU, one for US, one for Asia)
* API instance - 1x
